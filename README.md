# WhoWroteIt
In this app we used AsyncTask.
Which is used to work in background and make ui thread free to operate by users. 
It is good to provide a good user experience as the another thread is working in background then the ui thread should response something everything second to 
entertain the user otherwise he will not know what is happening and close the app.
